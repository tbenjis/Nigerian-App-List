# Nigerian App List
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/tbenjis/Nigerian-App-List.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/tbenjis/Nigerian-App-List)

We decided to maintain an open list of good mobile applications built in Nigeria or developed for Nigerians. This will allow Nigerians find locally developed mobile applications on different platforms.


## How to add an app 

If you find a good mobile app developed by Nigerians or for Nigerians, you can follow these few steps to add them to the list:

- Fork the repo.
- Paste the information in the JSON file (applist.json). Here is an example below:

```json
{
    "appName": "Akpos Jokes",
    "appPublisher": "StackArena",
    "publisherUrl": "http://www.stackarena.com/",
    "appCategory": "Entertainment",
    "appDescription": "Akpos jokes app provides funny jokes on your mobile phone, you can add yours and rate others.",
    "appLogo": "img/apps/akposjokes.jpg",
    "appLink": [
                    {
                        "type": "Android",
                        "url": "https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.stackarena.akposjokes"
                    }
        ]
},
{
    "appName": "Jobberman",
    "appPublisher": "Jobberman",
    "publisherUrl": "http://www.jobberman.com",
    "appCategory": "Social",
    "appDescription": "Get access to jobs and vacancies in Nigeria from Nigeria's Jobs Website. Jobberman.com",
    "appLogo": "img/apps/jobberman.jpg",
    "appLink": [                
                    {
                        "type": "Android",
                        "url": "https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jobberman"
                    },
                    {
                        "type": "IOS",
                        "url": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/jobberman/id716603451?mt=8"
                    }                
        ]
}
```

- Also include a .jpg file of the app logo in (img/apps) folder Note image should be 228x228 and less than 30kb. You can use http://compressjpeg.com/ to compress JPEG files.
